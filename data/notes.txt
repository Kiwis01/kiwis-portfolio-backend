EDUCATION
Arizona State University Aug 2020 - May 2025
Bachelor of Science, Computer Science
• Coursework: Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer &
Network Forensics, Distributed Systems, Information Assurance, Web Development with Java, Embedded Microprocessor Systems
EXPERIENCE
University of Phoenix Software Engineering Intern May 2025 - Aug 2025
Tempe, AZ, USA
• Developed a pull request agent using Bitbucket API, LangChain, and Qdrant that analyzed code changes with Python, enabling tech
leads to catch logic errors and coding mistakes in ~10 seconds.
• Enhanced system functionality by integrating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to detect cross-file impacts and
improve code analysis accuracy.
• Implemented asynchronous Amazon SQS pipelines to resolve webhook timeouts and reduce CI/CD delays by ~30 seconds.
• Designed and deployed a Kafka-based microservice in Java on AWS (S3 + Lambda) to audit over 100 access keys, uncovering 62
orphaned policies and 30 missing team entries, thereby promoting company-wide security compliance.
• Coordinated incident response during Cognito/credentials deprecations, introducing 2 new security measures to eliminate system
downtime.
City of Phoenix Software Engineering Intern Sep 2024 - Apr 2025
Phoenix, AZ, USA
• Optimized SQL queries and restructured database schemas to reduce asset lookup times from 72 minutes to under 5 seconds (~7,000x
faster), supporting a large-scale government database migration with zero downtime.
• Enhanced asset identification output by 3x through improved indexing and tagging workflows, demonstrating efficient data handling
in RDBMS environments.
• Consolidated 200+ documentation resources into a single linked system, reducing retrieval time from hours to under a minute while
ensuring streamlined information accessibility.
PROJECTS & OUTSIDE EXPERIENCE
AI Engineer & CTO Jun 2023 - Present
Healthy | heathy.org Hermosillo, Mexico
• Co-founded and led the development of a unified healthcare platform now used in pilot programs across public hospitals in Hermosillo,
Mexico. Doctors can now access complete patient health records, lab reports, and imaging (DICOM) through a single interface.
• Conducted 42,000+ pilot tests with physicians, incorporating their feedback to fine tune usability, workflows, and accuracy.
• Integrated AI tools (YOLOv8 + MedSAM + MONAI) to detect, classify, and segment brain tumors in medical images. Achieved 88.9%
accuracy while making anomalies clearly visible across multiple scan layers.
• Leveraged MedGemma to interpret textual reports alongside the imaging results, providing multimodal diagnostic insights.
• Deployed on AWS with HIPAA-compliant architecture, following engineering standards, CI/CD pipelines, and security best practices
to ensure scalability and reliability.
Medical Assistant for pre diagnoses Aug 2024 - Apr 2025
Chmltech Ltd.
• Designed a mixture-of-agents architecture (independently, before tools like LangChain) where a supervising agent coordinated multiple
specialized agents through structured prompts.
• Built a custom multimodal pipeline combining MRI imaging and patient records, enabling richer pre-diagnostic support for doctors.
• Leveraged Roboflow and React for the application layer, while integrating PyTorch models to classify brain tumors and extract relevant
medical features.
• Deployed a prototype medical assistant capable of providing AI-powered insights from both imaging and textual medical data, laying
the groundwork for future clinical testing.
TECHNICAL SKILLS
• Programming Languages: Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, PyTorch, Pydicom), Java, C/C++, JavaScript, C#/.NET
• Developer Tools: Git, Docker, Linux/Unix, Bitbucket, AWS, Spacelift, Postman, Apache Kafka, Unity
• Databases: SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL), MongoDB, Vector Databases (Qdrant, Chroma)
PUBLICATIONS
